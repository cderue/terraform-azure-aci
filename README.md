# Terraform No-Code Infrastructure Module for Azure Container Instances

The Terraform No-Code Infrastructure Module for Azure Container Instances (ACI) simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications on Azure without requiring deep Terraform knowledge. This module provides a configuration-driven approach to running lightweight, serverless containers without the complexity of managing Kubernetes or virtual machines.

## Key features:
- No-code deployment – Deploy containers using simple configuration files, eliminating the need for complex Terraform scripts.
- Serverless containers – Run containers on demand without provisioning or managing infrastructure.
- Fast startup – Launch containers in seconds for quick workloads and ephemeral applications.
- Security & networking – Configure managed identities, virtual networks (VNETs), private endpoints, and secure authentication.
- CI/CD integration – Automate container deployments with GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or other pipelines.

## Use cases:
- Running stateless applications, microservices, and APIs.
- Batch processing, automation scripts, and background jobs.
- Rapid prototyping and testing of containerized applications.
